# assignment 2B

Using same transformation methodologies (case normalization, number normalization, Punctuation,
stop word removal and lemmatization) on the hold out data set (as depicted in the week6 code)
obtain the F1 store for hold out data set. You can build something from scratch, or use classes
you have already built or use the code that I have provided in the week's code.

Bonus points if you improve your F1 score (on hold out) by doing some feature engineering through EDA
or by using more advanced vectorization.

Good luck
